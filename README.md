# Fabric-Defect-Classification-with-CNNs
This Python script is designed for fabric defect classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code utilizes the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training CNN models. The dataset consists of fabric images with five categories of defects: Hole, Horizontal Line, Isolated Defect, Needle Lines, and Vertical Line.
